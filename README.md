Sikuli IDE is targeted at people who want to develop and run scripts using Sikuli features with one of the supported scripting languages (currently Python - more scripting languages to come) in a lightweight IDE with special support for the visual approach provided by Sikuli.
<br /><br />
The downloadable packages of Sikuli IDE contain everything needed for all purposes (but it should not be used with standalone Jython to avoid conflicts with the bundled Jython - use sikuli-java.jar instead from [Sikuli API](https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-API))
<br /><br />
For the use of Sikuli features in Java programs, other Java based languages or Java aware scripting languages currently not supported by Sikuli IDE you should use [Sikuli API](https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-API) with other IDE's like Eclipse, NetBeans, ...

Same goes for people who want to develop, run and debug scripts using SikuliX-IDE supported scripting languages in other IDE's like Eclipse, Netbeans, ...
<br /><br />
This repo is **fully Maven**, so a fork of this repo can be directly used as project in NetBeans/Eclipse/... or with mvn on commandline. <br />
It depends on [Sikuli API](https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-API), [Sikuli Jython](https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-Jython) and [Sikuli Basics](https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-Basics).<br />
